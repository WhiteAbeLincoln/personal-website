# SAT Solver

This project consists of two implementations of a SAT solver, created for CS5550 - Parallel Programming. A notable feature is that both implementations are written in a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style using [Emacs org-mode](https://orgmode.org/).

You can view the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/WhiteAbeLincoln/sat-solver).

## Overview

The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is an NP-complete decision problem,
where the goal is to find whether there is an assignment of values to boolean variables
in a propositional formula such that the formula evaluates to true. For example,
determining whether $$ a \land \neg a $$ can be true for some value of $a$ is
an SAT problem.

Most SAT solvers take their input as a propositional logic formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF),
involving variables and the operators _negation_ ($\neg$), _disjunction_ ($\lor$), and _conjunction_ ($\land$). A
propositional logic formula in CNF is the conjunction of a set of clauses. A _clause_ is a disjunction
of literals, and a _literal_ is a boolean variable $A$ which can be either positive ($A$), or negative ($\neg A$).

Both solutions are C++ implementations of the DPLL algorithm:

```python
def dpll(F: Formula):
  if F is empty:
    return SAT
  else if F contains empty clause:
    return UNSAT
  else if F contains pure literal l:
    return dpll(F[l -> ⊤])
  else if F contains unit clause [l]:
    return dpll(F[l -> ⊤])
  else
    let l be a literal in F
    if dpll(F[l -> ⊤]) = SAT:
      return SAT
    else:
      return dpll(F[l -> ⊥])
```

## Serial

The basic DPLL algorithm can be defined recursively.
In the algorithm, $F[l \to \top]$ denotes the formula obtained by replacing the literal $l$ with $\top$ and
$\neg l$ with $\bot$ in $F$. A literal is pure if it occurs in $F$ but its opposite does not. A clause is unit
if it contains only one literal.

The DPLL algorithm consists of two key steps:

1. _Literal Elimination_: If some literal is only seen in pure form, we can immediately determine the
   truth value for that literal. For instance, if the literal is in the form $A$, we know that $A$ must be
   $\top$, and if the literal is in the form $\neg A$, $A$ must be $\bot$.
2. _Unit Propogation_: If there is a unit clause then we can immediately assign a truth value in the same
   way we do for literal elimination.

## Parallel

This implementation also uses the DPLL algorithm, parallelizing it using the _portfolio_ method.

Parallel SAT solvers come in two variants, _portfolio_ and _divide-and-conquer_. A portfolio solver
uses many different serial solvers, all racing to complete a single formula. This strategy is competitive
because different formulas may benefit from different choices in branching strategy, but determining this
from the beginning would be difficult.

A divide-and-conquer solver splits the search space, sending part of the problem to identical serial solvers.
These solvers communicate back to the main process, sending learned variables or conflict clauses.

The key difference in this implementation from the serial version is the use of branching. The final case of the DPLL algorithm is to choose a literal $l$ from $F$, which can be done using different heuristics. In the serial implementation, we choose a single branching strategy at the start. For the parallel implementation, we instead use [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) to spawn multiple processes, each attempting to solve the SAT problem using a different branching heuristic.
